            <div className="description">There is an old saying that life is a journey. In fact, life is many journeys.
             The more of them you take, the longer it will seem. I thought about this. Then I thought about my childhood.
              It turns out that I rode the bus to school nearly 200 days a year for more than 10 years. That’s 2,000 days.
               I don’t remember most of those days. They blur together. But when I was a child, once a year, we would 
               take a family vacation. I remember every single one of these. The first one was to St Louis. It was the 
               first time I was on an airplane. My sister was maybe 2 or 3 years old. I remember her in her little
                stroller. Each year we took a trip. Dallas. Baltimore. Chicago. Seattle. When I look back on my life 
                and the experiences I have had, I think back to these journeys. I remember every one of them. They are 
                vivid life experiences that I shared with the people I care about. My life is longer because of the 
                journeys I have taken. When I am on my death bed, I want to look back at my life, and have all these 
                vivid memories. I want them to be full and different every single day</div>
